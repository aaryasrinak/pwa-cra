8. How to get hired as a intern(full-stack) in companies like google, meta, amazon etc.,

1. there is no final answer for this, it is different from company to company
2. learn how to learn, it is quite common that you should be able to learn new lang in a week (not a master but understand and can use it for basic task)
3. no need to learn all langs but it is necessary to practice by creating webapps
4. mm, I think you have to find a correct answer by yourself, for me it would be the feeling of `so, what next` this question in my head make me want to learn more
5. I found this website last month (https://www.frontendmentor.io) and try to build a todo app based on their frontend design + my imagination about backend. also you may check this https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld (realworld app will provide specifications and you create the app based on spec like in real world)
6. struggling is quite common, just keep practicing. I think this is kind of brain exercise, only way to get muscle is keep it going
7. you can find a lot of portfolios by googling, I don't update for long and don't remember where it is, haha
8. have no idea with that
